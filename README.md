# Project 0 Nick Kennedy 30145355
My project is a webiste showing evidence of aliens on earth. It contains 4 pages 
detailing things like evidence, controlled people, and survival techniques. 

All pages share the same header navbar containing links to the other pages as well as
a alien GIF image.

Files-
index.html -> this is the main page. it has text intoducing the project, and
              also contains sources for all of the images used on the site.

Evidence.html -> this page has a bootstrap4 carosel component showing various
                 images of alien activity. the sources for all of the images
                 can be found on index.html.

Compromised.html -> very similar to Evidence.html, except this one has a carosel
                    showing various celebrities who have been mind controlled by
                    the aLiens.

StayingSafe.html -> this page has two boostrap4 columns that have been styled using
                    SCSS that show how to fight back and stay safe from  the aliens.

pagestyle.css ->    this is the css file that is used to style the majority of the
                    website. it is called at the beginning of every .html file

safetystyle.SCSS -> SCSS file to style the staying safe page. SCSS is used to create
                    2 custom variables, as well as style the two columns on the page
                    using inheritance and nesting CSS.

safetystyle.css -> CSS file created from safetystyle.scss, called at the beginning
                   of StayingSafe.html

README.md ->    This file

All other files are just images that are used throughout the project (again, all
of the images are sourced on index.html)
